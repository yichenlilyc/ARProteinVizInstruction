> There are three ways to load the model:
  - **Load from RCSB:** input the PDB ID and directly load the model from RCSB database (video)
  - **Load from the cloud:** here you can load the models you uploaded. To do this, you need to upload your own models first (get more details at Step 5 :Upload models). 
  - **Load from input text:** you can copy and paste the .pdb file here or you can load the text from your local disk by clicking the button below. After you input the text, click at “load M1 from panel textarea” to view the model. (video)
2. After you load the model, put the marker in front of the camera and view the model:

2. If you are visualizing the structure **on laptop**, you can control the structure by mouse:
- Hold left mouse button to drag and move
- Hole right mouse button to rotate
- Scroll to zoom in/out
3. If you are using **the mobile device** to do the visualization, you can use your fingers to control the structure:
